# Introduction

This project translate the `rdkafka.h` header file from [edenhill/librdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka) to Delphi unit.

Building the `librdkafka` project requires extra works.  To ease the translation and deployment, download ready made header and runtime libraries files from [nuget/librdkafka](https://www.nuget.org/packages/librdkafka.redist/).

# Translation Tools

The translation use [neslib/Chet](https://github.com/neslib/Chet) to perform initial work.  Some touch up works are necessary to make a perfect translation.
